        <p>
            I have always loved helping people which then led me to the healthcare field. Being a registered respiratry therapist it has allowed me to connect with many people both in the acute and chronic status of health. 
            From my time working in a level trauma hopsital to now working in a small outpatient cardiopulmonary rehab setting. I found myself needing an outlet from the chronic stress which has led me to learning coding and web development.

        <p>
            I'm excited to see where this new skill takes me to helping people in a different way. 
        </p>

            My purpose for this website is to put myself out there in a new way. My goal is to be able to bring awareness to chronic lung disease and help education those who are newly diagnosised or living in the chronic state. 
            My hope is that I'm able to use this platform to bridge gaps where healthcare lacks and help use technology to reach people who are looking for new ideas.
