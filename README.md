I've always been on to be learning new things so while I'm a skilled healthcare provider I find coding to allow my creativity flow as another way of giving back to others. I love collaborating not only with my patients but clients as well. Making visions a reality not only bring my clients joy, but me as well. 

Have a question or want to collaborate? Lets talk!
