This is my very first website project. 

I have attempted my best thus far and look forward to learning more about being a full stacked web developer. 

Some challenges I faced with this project
-being patient with myself and learning
-becoming a perfectionist with my work
-mobile web dev and CSS media queries 

Growth comes with hard work and I plan to keep pushing hard to succeed.
